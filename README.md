The Dynamic Menu Builder is a React-based web application that allows users to create and manage multi-level navigation menus with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

React Hooks: The application leverages React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage menu state and persist data to localStorage. This ensures that the menu structure remains intact even after refreshing the browser.

Context API: A MenuContext is created using the Context API to maintain a global menu state. This helps in sharing the menu data and related functions across different components without passing props, thereby improving code modularity and reducing prop drilling.

The app’s core functionality is centered on managing a nested menu structure. Here’s a breakdown:
Adding a Menu Item: Users can add a main menu item or a submenu under an existing item.
Editing and Deleting Items: Each item in the menu has options to edit or delete. When editing, the user can change the item’s name, and it’s immediately updated in the menu structure.


Project Structure
src/context/MenuContext.js: Houses the MenuContext and provides functions like addMenuItem, editMenuItem, deleteMenuItem, and toggleTheme.
src/components/MenuBuilder.js: The primary UI component for building and displaying the menu. This component uses recursion to render nested menus.
src/App.js: The root component that includes the theme toggle button and initializes the MenuProvider.
src/App.css: Contains basic styles for the layout, responsive design, and theme.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
